Hello! My name is Justyna from Poland, currently 7 years in Berlin (I prefer the short version, Justi). I do content on film and tech from FLINTA* perspective. I am a data-driven project manager, therefore I can easily communicate with stakeholders. In addition, these skills are sharpened through improv comedy. I specialize in music and truthful comedy, which means a deep understanding of the present moment. I make music in Super Collider and enjoy Algoraves.
