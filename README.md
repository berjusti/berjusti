Hello! My name is Justyna from Poland, currently 7 years in Berlin (I prefer the short version Justi).
I do content on film and tech on my website https://www.filmthewomen.com/ . I enjoy creating data-driven solutions and learning new languages. Currently I expand my knowledge from the IronHack Bootcamp through the CS50 course from Harvard as well and study non-relational databases, NLP and Machine Learning. Furthermore I am a data-driven project manager, therefore I can easily communicate with stakeholders.  In addition these skills are sharpened through regular participation in the Berlin improv comedy community through Comedy Cafe Berlin. I specialise in music and truthful comedy, which means deep understanding of the present moment. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a film recommender that utilises Natural Language Processing to minimise the hurdles of selecting a right movie to watch.
